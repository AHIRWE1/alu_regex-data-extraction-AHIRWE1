# alu_regex-data-extraction-AHIRWE1
# Regex Data Extraction Tool

This Python script uses **regular expressions (regex)** to extract specific types of data from a text file.




What the Script Does

The script reads a file called `sample_text.txt` and searches for different types of information like:

- Email addresses  
- Website URLs  
- Phone numbers  
- Currency amounts (like $19.99 or $1,234.56)  
- HTML tags (like `<p>`, `<div>`, etc.)

It then prints out each category of data it finds.



How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.

You can check by running:

```bash
python --version

2. Run the script
In your terminal, write

```bash
python extract_data.py

Make sure the file sample_text.txt is in the same folder.
